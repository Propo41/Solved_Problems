Prefix reversal using bfs is used to solve the problem.
*/





/*
Returns the min number of prefix reversals required to sort the array
in ascending order

HOW: BFS is used. We think of each node as a permutation of the strings being reversed in prefix order.
For example: (3 1 2) is first reversed to (1 3 2) and then (2 1 3) in a linear fashion. So, in this case,
both (1 3 2) and (2 1 3) are considered as nodes that are to be pushed into the bfs queue.
The number of reversals required are tracked using a pair object.
The pair holds both the nodes (aka strings) and the count for the amount of reversals performed

    map <string, bool> visited;

    bfs_queue.push(curr);

        // permute the string by reversing every characters from index 2 to n
        // and push it into the queue
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        {
            // storing the string in a temp variable to keep it unscathed,
            //since we'll be needing it for rest of the iterations
            string temp = curr.first;
            // reverse the string till prefix i
            reverse(temp.begin(), temp.begin()+i);
